Kubero v3 Releases: Now Powered by NestJS ðŸš€
Kubero: The self-hosted Heroku/Coolify alternative, is released in version v3

Hey everyone,

I'm excited to announce that Kubero v3 is officially out! ðŸŽ‰

This release comes with a major internal overhaul â€” the entire backend has been refactored and migrated from Express.js to NestJS.

ðŸ”¥ What is Kubero?
Kubero is a self-hosted PaaS alternative to Heroku, Vercel, and Coolify running on any Kubernetes cluster. The UI makes it simple to deploy your code with GitOps workflows and simplifies the deployment of any containerized apps on Kubernetes.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s new in v3?
Backend rebuilt in NestJS â€“ migrated from Express for better structure and scalability.

- JWT authentication â€“ replacing session-based auth for better security
- API redesigned â€“ ubnified and cleaner endpoints, https://demo.kubero.dev/api/docs
- Improved logging & error handling
- 86% test coverage with Jest
- No changes to the frontend â€“ UI remains stable and familiar (for now)

This release is mostly about laying a strong foundation for upcoming features like role-based access and team support.

ðŸ“¦ Upgrade Notes
- In-place upgrade â€” just update the tag to v3.0.0. All features and configurations are compatible with v2
- CLI users: update to v3.0.0
- If youâ€™re using the API directly, note the new paths in the docs above

As always: Kubero is 100% open-source and community-driven. CNCF donation is still on our roadmap to help secure its future.

Would love your feedback, questions, or suggestions! ðŸ™Œ
