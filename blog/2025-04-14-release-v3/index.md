*Hey everyone,*

I'm excited to announce that Kubero v3 is officially out! ðŸŽ‰

This release comes with a major internal overhaul â€” we've refactored the entire backend and migrated from Express.js to NestJS. **All features from v2 are migrated and still available.**

## Why the switch to NestJS?
While Express served us well in v1 and v2, NestJS brings a lot to the table that helps Kubero grow into a more scalable and maintainable platform:

- Modular architecture: NestJS encourages a more structured, modular codebase, making it easier to manage features, dependencies, and scale the app. It makes it easier for contributors to dive in and build with us.

- Improved security: Kubero uses now JWT tokens for authentication, which are more secure and easier to manage than the previous session-based approach.

- Community & Ecosystem: NestJS has a thriving community and integrates well with a lot of other tools weâ€™re already using (passport.js).

This update sets the stage for bigger features in the future like role based access and team structures.

As always, Kubero remains open-source and community-driven. Donating this projet to CNCF is still on the roadmap to ensure its longevity and sustainability.

## Upgrade Notes
- There should be no issues upgrading. In case you are using the CLI make sure to update it as well.
- In case you are using the api, make sure to use the new paths

Would love to hear your feedback, questions, or thoughts. Thanks for being part of the journey!
