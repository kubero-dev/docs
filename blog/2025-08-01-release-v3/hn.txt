Show HN: Open-source Heroku PaaS alternative

Hey HN,

I’m the creator of Kubero, an open-source PaaS. I've been working on it for the past 3 years. The idea was born during Heroku’s major outage in 2022, when I realized how much we rely on closed platforms — and how fragile that can be. The main goal is to keep the workflows and simplicity of Heroku, but with the freedom and control of self-hosting. Developers are empowered to take charge of their infrastructure. No infrastructure hassle — just push your code, and it runs.

Kubero is running on Kubernetes, as an operator. It comes with an intuitive web UI, Accessible API, and a CLI. It supports Dockerfiles, Nixpacks, Runpacks, and Buildpacks for building your applications. You can deploy any containerized app with ease. Or just use the 170+ pre-configured templates to get started quickly. It’s designed to be user-friendly, even for those who aren’t Kubernetes experts.

💡 Core Features:
- Run any docker container with Add-Ons (Postgres, Redis, etc.)
- Git-based deployments (just git push)
- Starting Apps with a pull request
- High availability and autoscaling
- App metrics and logs
- 170+ pre-configured templates for quick setup
- API for automation and integration
- CLI for easy management and installation
- Web-Console and Logs in the UI
- SSL handling with cert manager
... 

I’ve also put together a detailed feature comparison with Heroku here:

🔥 What’s New in v3:
- Built-in User Management –> Roles, API tokens, permission system.
- Team Views –> Manage multiple teams/projects in one instance.
- Multi-language support (English, German, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, ... more to come)
- Tested and Stable –> 500+ Jest tests, ~85% test coverage.

Kubero is 100% open source and welcomes contributors. If you’ve ever wanted more control over your app platform — or just want a break from vendor lock-in — give it a try!
